              Weather refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions in a
              specific place at a specific time. It includes elements such as
              temperature, humidity, precipitation (rain, snow, etc.), wind
              speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, and cloud cover. Unlike
              climate, which is the average pattern of weather over a long
              period, weather is temporary and can change from hour to hour or
              day to day. People experience weather daily and it directly
              affects activities like travel, farming, and clothing choices.
            </p>

            <p>
              Weather is primarily driven by the sun's energy. When sunlight
              reaches Earth, it heats the surface unevenly due to differences in
              terrain, water bodies, and atmospheric composition. This uneven
              heating causes air to rise and fall, creating pressure differences
              that lead to wind and storm systems. The water cycle—evaporation,
              condensation, and precipitation—also plays a crucial role in
              forming clouds and delivering rain or snow. Geography, like
              mountains and oceans, influences local weather by shaping wind
              patterns and moisture availability.
            </p>

            <p>
              Different types of weather patterns include sunny, cloudy, rainy,
              snowy, foggy, windy, and stormy conditions. Weather can range from
              calm and pleasant to extreme and hazardous. Severe weather events
              such as thunderstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and blizzards can
              cause major disruptions and pose risks to life and property.
              That’s why meteorologists constantly monitor atmospheric data
              using satellites, radar, and sensors to forecast weather and issue
              warnings.

            <p>
              In modern times, weather forecasting has become more accurate due
              to advances in computer modeling and technology. Apps and websites
              now provide hourly and weekly forecasts for almost every location
              on Earth. Understanding weather not only helps individuals plan
              their daily lives, but it is also crucial for sectors like
              aviation, agriculture, disaster management, and energy production.
              As climate change impacts long-term trends, studying weather helps
              scientists track changes in patterns and predict future
              environmental challenges.
